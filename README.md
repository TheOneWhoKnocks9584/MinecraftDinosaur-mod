i am trying to make a minecraft dinosaur mod just like the mod unusual prehistory but with more dinosaurs hopefully!

I’ve started creating the dinosaur models (I will be uploading them here soon).
I am new to coding, animations, and modding, so this project is a learning experience for me.
I’m looking for people who have experience in coding and animations
If you have knowledge in either of these areas and would like to contribute to the project, please let me know!
In the meantime, I’ll be continuing to work on more models to add to the mod.
